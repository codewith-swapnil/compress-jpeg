  "how_compression_works_q": "How does image compression work?",
  "how_compression_works_a": "Image compression, especially for formats like JPG and WebP, involves a 'lossy' algorithm. This means it intelligently reduces file size by discarding some visual data that is less perceptible to the human eye. For PNG and GIF, it uses 'lossless' techniques to reduce size without any quality loss. You maintain full control over the compression level using our intuitive quality slider or by setting individual image qualities.",
  "supported_formats_q": "What image formats are supported?",
  "supported_formats_a_long": "SwiftCompress supports the most common image formats: JPEG/JPG for photographs, PNG for images with transparency, WebP for modern web optimization, and GIF for animated images (though GIFs are primarily converted to static images for compression). Our goal is to provide versatile compression for all your needs.",
